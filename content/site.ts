  narrative: `Where it Started : 
One cold July night, fate has brought together two hearts: one broken, one still acclimatizing. With a bond slowly woven by God’s perfect plan, strangers turn into friends. With a shared love for music, animals, food, and movies, the bond becomes thicker and the distance, nearer. Love sparked naturally, as if it had already been destined to be.
As we shared more moments together, we’ve become inseparable. We have been each other’s source of joy, a shoulder to cry on, and armor to make ourselves feel stronger. Through ups and downs, through literal sickness and health, we have always been on each other’s side. 
It is not just our love that grew; our bodies also grew, doubling our size. But as research says, contented long-term relationships can add pounds of “happy weight.” 

2025, This is it : 
Being together for 13 years made them know each other’s strengths and weaknesses, their imperfections and flaws. It is high time for them to seal the deal. There were no fancy proposals, no rings, no surprises – it was a mutual decision that this year would be the year for them to finally get married.`,
  giftNote: `With all that we have, we are truly blessed. Your presence and prayer are all that we request.
 But if you desire to give nonetheless, a monetary gift is the one we suggest.`,
